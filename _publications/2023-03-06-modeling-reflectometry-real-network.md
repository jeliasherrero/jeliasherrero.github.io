Today, the classification and location of faults in electrical networks remains 
a topic of great interest. Faults are a major issue, mainly due to the time spent 
to detect, locate, and repair the cause of the fault.

To reduce time and associated  costs, automatic fault classification and location is gaining great interest. 
State-of-the-art techniques to classify and locate faults are mainly based on 
line-impedance measurements or the detection of the traveling wave produced by 
the event caused by the fault itself. In contrast, this paper describes the 
methodology for creating a database and a model for a complex distribution network. 
Both objectives are covered under the paradigm of the time-domain pulse 
reflectometry (TDR) principle. By using this technique, large distances can be 
monitored on a line with a single device. 

Thus, in this way a database is shared 
and created from the results of simulations of a real and complex distribution 
network modeled in the PSCADTM software, which have been validated with measurements 
from an experimental test setup. Experimental validations have shown that the 
combination of the TDR technique with the modeling of a real network (including 
the real injector and the network coupling filter from the prototype) provides 
high-quality signals that are very similar and reliable to the real ones.

In this sense, it is intended firstly that this model and its corresponding data 
will serve as a basis for further processing by any of the existing state-of-the-art 
techniques. And secondly, to become a valid alternative to the already well-known 
Test Feeders but adapted to work groups not used to the electrical world but to the 
environment of pure data processing.
