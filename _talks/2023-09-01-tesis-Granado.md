Automatic detection, classification and location of power line faults is a crucial process in the electrical power 
industry. It consists of quickly identifying and locating any type of fault or interruption on a power line such 
as short circuits, earth faults or faults in the electrical distribution system.

From a maintenance cost point of view, distribution system operators (DSOs) are particularly concerned with 
reducing outage times. From a commercial point of view, during these periods an undetermined number of 
customers lose their electricity supply, and some power generation plants (especially distributed generation, DG) 
may also be affected. Therefore, locating electrical faults in distribution networks and identifying them 
are effective methods to reduce the duration of downtime, considering that most outages are caused by faults 
in the distribution network. When maintenance teams can find the problem faster thanks to location and 
identification techniques, the fault can be repaired sooner and, therefore, the user experience is considerably 
improved.

The following image shows the route taken during this research project which led to the presentation of the doctoral 
thesis of the same name by [Javier Granado Forn√°s](https://es.linkedin.com/in/javiergranadofornas).
